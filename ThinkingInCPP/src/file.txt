AB Conventional continuum damage descriptions of material degeneration
   suffer from loss of well-posedness beyond a certain level of accumulated
   damage. As a consequence, numerical solutions are obtained which are
   unacceptable from a physical point of view. The introduction of
   higher-order deformation gradients in the constitutive model is
   demonstrated to be an adequate remedy to this deficiency of standard
   damage models. A consistent numerical solution procedure of the
   governing partial; differential equations is presented, which is shown
   to be capable of properly simulating localization phenomena.
